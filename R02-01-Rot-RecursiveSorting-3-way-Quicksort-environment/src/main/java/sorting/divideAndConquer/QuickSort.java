 * Quicksort is based on the divide-and-conquer paradigm. The algorithm chooses
 * a pivot element and rearranges the elements of the interval in such a way
 * that all elements lesser than the pivot go to the left part of the array and
 * all elements greater than the pivot, go to the right part of the array. Then
 * it recursively sorts the left and the right parts. Notice that if the list
 * has length == 1, it is already sorted.
