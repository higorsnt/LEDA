/**
 * This algorithm applies two bubblesorts simultaneously. In a same iteration, a
 * bubblesort pushes the greatest elements to the right and another bubblesort
 * pushes the smallest elements to the left. At the end of the first iteration,
 * the smallest element is in the first position (index 0) and the greatest
 * element is the last position (index N-1). The next iteration does the same
 * from index 1 to index N-2. And so on. The execution continues until the array
 * is completely ordered.
